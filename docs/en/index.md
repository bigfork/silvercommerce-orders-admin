# Orders Admin For SilverStripe

This module is designed to add estimate and invoice management
to a SilverStripe install.

Included is an `Invoice` and `Estimate` model class and a `ModelAdmin`
interface to view/edit. There is also a comprehensive set of permissions
available for finer grain user access to invoices and estimates.

You can also access a "rendered" invoice (either via the browser or a PDF,
rendered via DOMPDF).
