# Invoice Notifications

This module currently supports automated notifications that are sent
out when an invoice is set to a particular status (such as "paid",
"dispatched", "etc").

These notifications are managed via `SiteConfig` and can be created by
navigating to:

Settings > Shop > Invoice Notifications

You can then create as many notifications as you like, each assigned
to a particular status (you can even send out multiple notifications
per status).
